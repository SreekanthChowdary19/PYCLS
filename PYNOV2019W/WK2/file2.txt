In the early medieval era, Christianity, Islam, Judaism and Zoroastrianism put down roots on India's southern and western coasts.[33] Armies from Central Asia intermittently overran India's plains,[34] eventually establishing the Delhi sultanate, and drawing northern India into the cosmopolitan networks of medieval Islam.[35] In the 15th century, the Vijayanagara Empire created a long-lasting composite Hindu culture in south India.[36] In the Punjab, Sikhism emerged, rejecting institutionalized religion.[37] The Mughal empire, in 1526, ushered in two centuries of relative peace,[38] leaving a legacy of luminous architecture.[g][39] Gradually expanding rule of the British East India Company followed, turning India into a colonial economy, but also consolidating its sovereignty.[40] British Crown rule began in 1858. The rights promised to Indians were granted slowly,[41] but technological changes were introduced, and ideas of education, modernity and the public life took root.[42] A pioneering and influential nationalist movement emerged,[43] which was noted for nonviolent resistance and led India to its independence in 1947.

India is a secular federal republic governed in a democratic parliamentary system. It is a pluralistic, multilingual and multi-ethnic society. India's population grew from 361 million in 1951 to 1,211 million in 2011.[44] During the same time, its nominal per capita income increased from US$64 annually to US$1,498, and its literacy rate from 16.6% to 74%. From being a comparatively destitute country in 1951,[45] India has become a fast-growing major economy, a hub for information technology services, with an expanding middle class.[46] It has a space programme which includes several planned or completed extraterrestrial missions. Indian movies, music, and spiritual teachings play an increasing role in global culture.[47] India has substantially reduced its rate of poverty, though at the cost of increasing economic inequality.[48] India is a nuclear weapons state, which ranks high in military expenditure. It has disputes over Kashmir with its neighbours, Pakistan and China, unresolved since the mid-20th century.[49] Among the socio-economic challenges India faces are gender inequality, child malnutrition,[50] and rising levels of air pollution.[51] India's land is megadiverse, with four biodiversity hotspots.[52] Its forest cover comprises 21.4% of its area.[53] India's wildlife, which has traditionally been viewed with tolerance in India's culture,[54] is supported among these forests, and elsewhere, in protected habitats.
