Class is a Logical Entity
Object is a Real enitity

Why OOPS?
To design our program


Object -->  Attributes
            Behaviours


Person --> Attributes of an object we can represent using DATA TYPES
            name  ===> String
            age    ===> Integer
            ht     ===> Float
           Behaviours nothing but action doing by the object - Functions

          sleep()
          walk()
          talk()

OOPS Priniciples:
Inheritance
Abstarction
Polomorphism
Encapsulation
