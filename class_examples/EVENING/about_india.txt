India is a great nation.

India was in past, India is in present, and India will be in future.

Those foreign invaders ruled here, they all were idiots. They looted wealth, killed millions of people, caused so much harm.

They still couldn’t touch the real treasure of India, i.e spirituality.

Those idiots had to take this treasure, but they missed.

India is the land of Ram, Krishna, Buddha, Mahavira and many.

If India has to grow, need to move back and embrace it’s treasure.
