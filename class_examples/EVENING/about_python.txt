What is Python

Python is a general-purpose coding language—which means that, unlike HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it can be used for other types of programming and software development besides web development.

Python can be used for things like:

Back end (or server-side) web and mobile app development
Desktop app and software development
Processing big data and performing mathematical computations
Writing system scripts (creating instructions that tell a computer system to “do” something)
But don’t let Python’s broad range scare you. Just like those more familiar-sounding languages, Python is an easy to learn, in-demand programming language that can exponentially increase your chances of getting hired and income in a matter of months.
