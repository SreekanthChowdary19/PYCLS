The Dravidian languages are a language family spoken by more than 215 million people, mainly in Southern India and northern Sri Lanka, 
with pockets elsewhere in South Asia.[2] Since the colonial era, there have been small but significant immigrant communities
 outside South Asia in countries such as Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Mauritius and the Philippines.

Epigraphically the Dravidian languages are first attested in the 2nd century BCE as Tamil-Brahmi script on the 
cave walls discovered in the Madurai and Tirunelveli districts of Tamil Nadu.[3] The Dravidian languages with the most speakers are 
(in descending order of number of speakers) Telugu, Tamil, Kannada and Malayalam, all of which have long literary traditions. 
Smaller literary languages are Tulu and Kodava.[4] There are also small groups of Dravidian-speaking scheduled tribes, 
who live outside Dravidian-speaking areas, such as the Kurukh in Eastern India and Gondi in Central India.[5]

Only two Dravidian languages are spoken exclusively outside the post-1947 state of India: 
Brahui in the Balochistan region of Pakistan and Afghanistan; and Dhangar, a dialect of Kurukh,
 in parts of Nepal and Bhutan.[6] Dravidian place names along the Arabian Sea coasts and Dravidian 
grammatical influence such as clusivity in the Indo-Aryan languages, namely Marathi, Konkani, Gujarati, Marwari, and 
Sindhi, suggest that Dravidian languages were once spoken more widely across the Indian subcontinen
